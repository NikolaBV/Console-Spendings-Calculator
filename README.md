#Console application in C++ to help you calculate your weekly spendings

Especially important for univeristy students short on finances (just like myself)

#Installation

The application is as simple as a console application gets.
You clone the repository

---bash
git clone https://github.com/NikolaBV/Console-Spendings-Calculator.git
---

then you head to the "src" folder where the main cpp file is (Spendings.cpp)

you compile it 
---bash
g++ Spendings.cpp -o spendings
---

and run it
---bash
./spendings

That's it!
